# Usage: th = screened_coulomb_theta(e,s)
#
# Calculate the center-of-mass scattering angle
# for a screened Coulomb potential
#
# INPUT
#     e : reduced center-of-mass energy 
#     s : reduced impact factor
#
# The input arguments can be 
#   - arrays with the same number of elements 
#   - scalars
#   - one array and one scalar.
