OpenTRIM is a C++ Monte-Carlo code for simulating ion transport in materials with an emphasis on the calculation of material damage.

It consists of the following components:

- The \ref cliapp "`opentrim` command line program"
- `opentrim-gui` : A GUI tool to configure, run and evaluate simulations 
- The \ref MC with all the C++ ion transport code, which can be linked to by external applications
- A \ref XS "library of C++ classes" for screened Coulomb scattering calculations 
- The \ref dedx containing tables of electronic stopping data

## Credits

OpenTRIM draws heavily on the following similar open-source projects:

- The program [iradina](https://sourceforge.net/projects/iradina/) written by Ch. Borschel & C. Ronning and extended by J.P. Crocombette & Ch. Van Wambeke.
- The program [Corteo](http://www.lps.umontreal.ca/%7Eschiette/index.php?n=Recherche.Corteo) by F. Schiettekatte.

Electronic energy loss data has been obtained from the [SRIM-2013](http://www.srim.org/) distribution by  [J.F. Ziegler](ziegler[at]srim.org) using the provided utility `SRmodule.exe`

The [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library by B. Jacob & G. Guennebaud is used for 3D vector math.

The [Xoshiro256+](https://prng.di.unimi.it/) algorithm by D. Blackman and S. Vigna is used for random number generation.

[JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) by N. Lohmann is used for encoding/decoding program options to/from json.
