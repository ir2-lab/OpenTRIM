
Version history iradina

----------------------
Version:   1.0.0
Released:  2011-Jul-21
----------------------
First released version of iradina.


----------------------
Version:   1.0.1
Released:  2011-Nov-15
----------------------
+ combined input file (for easier use with GUI)
# some bug fixes


----------------------
Version:   1.0.2
Released:  2012-Dec-02
----------------------
+ various new input parameters
# a number of bugfixes


----------------------
Version:   1.0.3
Released:  2013-Jan-19
----------------------
# fixes a bug that sometimes cause program crashes when using PBC.


----------------------
Version:   1.0.4
Released:  2013-Feb-13
----------------------
# fixes a bug that causes some warning messages.


----------------------
Version:   1.0.5
Released:  2013-Jun-24
----------------------
# fixes a bug that causes negative energy deposition in the phononic
  system caused by overestimated straggling in hydrogen targets.


----------------------
Version:   1.0.6
Released:  2014-Jun-28
----------------------
# executable compiled as native 64 bit now works
# iradina now works with the high precision scattering matrix
  from corteo (2013).
# fixed bug: sometimes program crashed when ions enter material
# fixed bug: when ion enters material: SBE was subtracted instead of added
+ new config parameter store_range3d=1 tells iradina to create
  a file similar to range_3d.txt in SRIM.
+ additional output file with information on the simulation
+ new command line parameter -i
# in the nanoparticle version of iradina, the nanoparticle is now always
  centered in the simulation volume, regardless of the simulation volume's
  size.


----------------------
Version:   1.0.7
Released:  2014-Oct-25
----------------------
# fixed bug: error in vacancy counting (that occured when material was
  adjacent to non-periodic boundary).
# handling of recoils, that have replaced atoms, is improved (they now
  contribute to sputtering similar to sub-threshold recoils, but cannot
  leave the simulation volume).
# minor optimizations

----------------------
Version:   1.0.8
Released:  2016-Mar-02
----------------------
+ absolute recoil numbers are added to the cascade file as a fifth column in
  order to id each recoil. For full transport, the recursion depth for each
  recoil is added as a sixth column. This can be used to evaluate the
  collision cascade in more detail.
# fixed bug: possible seg fault when using empty target composition file with
  special_geometry.
# fixed bug in calculation of electronic energy loss straggling
# some more protection against invalid input parameters added to avoid crashes

----------------------
Version:   1.2.4
Released:  2019-Sep-09
----------------------
+ Kinchin-Pease quick calculation of damage, added by Jean-Paul Crocombette
  (SRIM-like mono-elemental or averaging)
+ new command line parameter -s allows output of electronic stopping table
+ more options for ion starting position
+ flexible corteo input data directory with command line option -data
+ ion entry point in x can be different from zero
+ store path limit for recoils cascades can be defined separately from limit
  for ions.
+ optional output of per cell results to one tab-separated table
+ optional parameter ion_dose to calculate desired concentration directly.
+ options for normalization factor
+ optional output of defects in units of DPA
+ possible output listing of primary knockons, to allow extraction of PKA
  spectrum later
+ new features in order to work with CEA GUI.
+ new option for data output: joined output in one file
+ new option for data output: header info in files
+ default config file with default options.
# fixed: replacement energy threshold can be set by user, default: lattice energy
  (before, displacement energy was used as threshold).
# source code optimizations, minor changes to improve program stability
