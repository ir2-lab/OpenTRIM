# Screened Coulomb potentials
The general form of the potential is

$$
V(r) = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r} \Phi(r/a)
$$

where $\Phi$ is the screening function and $a$ the screening length.

The scattering angle in the center-of-mass system can be obtained by
the scattering integral
$$
\theta = \pi - 2 s \int_{x_0}^\infty {x^{-2}F^{-1/2}(x)\,dx}
$$
where
$$
F(x) = 1 - \frac{\Phi(x)}{x\,\epsilon} - \frac{s^2}{x^2}
$$
and $x_0$ is the distance of the closest approach which satisfies
$F(x_0)=0$.

$\epsilon = E_{CM} a/Z_1 Z_2 e^2$ and $s = p/a$ are the
reduced center-of-mass energy and impact parameter.
